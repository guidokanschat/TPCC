 * \brief Tensor coordinates for a facet of dimension `k` in the complex of dimension `n`.
 *
 * Each element is characterized by its orientation and its
 * position in the complex. The orientation is
 * described by a combination of `k` coordinates which span the
 * element. It has no extension across these coordinates.
 *
 * The coordinates of an Element are stored in the array #positions. Its length is `n`and
 * it is ordered the same way as the coordinates in the whole chain complex. Thus, the first entry
 * in there refers to the 'global' first coordinate, no matter whether this is a coordinate direction
 * in which the Element extends. These global coordinates are accessed by operator[]().
 *
 * The `k` local coordinates of the Element in the directions in which it extends are accessed
 * by along_coordinate(). Their global counterparts are numbered by along_direction().
 *
 * The `n-k` coordinates orthogonal to the element are accessed by across_coordinate(). The
 * corresponding global directions are numbered by across_direction().
 *
 * An imbortant feature of Element is that you can obtain an Element object for each of its boundary
 * elements through facet().
 *
 * \tparam n: The dimension of the tensor chain complex
 * \tparam k: The dimension of this element
 * \tparam Sint: The integer type used for indexing in a single fiber
 * \tparam Tint: The integer type used for indexing fibers, directions, etc.
